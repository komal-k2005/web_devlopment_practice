        Mystery-thrillers are stories with twists and turns that keep you on
        your toes guessing about the truth, the POV's truth, and about what will
        happen next. They can be written from a hero's POV or from a sinister
        character's POV. Some are scary and make your heart beat faster, making
        it hard to put down. Some stories make you laugh if you have a witty
        writer with an unusual sense of humor easy to relate to. Both types can
        be hard to put down when they're page turners. And you can find many
        page turners among a variety of styles and writers, depending on what
        seeks your fancy. When it comes to twenty-first century Americansâ€™
        tastes in fiction, few genres sell better than crime, mystery, and
        thriller. The best books in these genres are gripping, suspenseful, and
        full of intrigue until the very end. They routinely top New York Times
        bestseller lists, and many spawn larger series, leaving enthralled
        readers eager for each new book.
