        Self-help books are a genre of literature that aims to provide guidance, advice, and strategies for personal growth and improvement.
These books cover a wide range of topics, including self-esteem, motivation, relationships, success, happiness, and overcoming obstacles.
Many self-help books draw on psychology, neuroscience, and personal anecdotes to offer practical tools and techniques for self-improvement.
They often encourage readers to reflect on their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors and provide strategies for changing negative patterns and developing positive habits.
Self-help books can be authored by psychologists, life coaches, spiritual leaders, or individuals who have overcome significant challenges in their own lives.
Some well-known self-help books include "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie, and "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle.
Self-help books are widely popular and can be found in various formats, including print, e-books, and audiobooks.
