        Young adult (YA) books are a genre of literature targeted towards readers aged approximately 12 to 18 years old.
These books typically feature protagonists in the same age range, allowing young readers to relate to and empathize with the characters' experiences.
YA books cover a wide range of genres, including contemporary fiction, fantasy, dystopian fiction, romance, and coming-of-age stories.
They often explore themes such as identity, friendship, love, self-discovery, mental health, and social issues, providing a platform for young readers to explore and understand complex topics.
YA books frequently address the challenges and issues faced by teenagers, including school, family dynamics, peer pressure, and personal growth.
Popular examples of YA books include "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins, "The Fault in Our Stars" by John Green, and the "Harry Potter" series by J.K. Rowling.
YA literature has gained significant popularity in recent years, attracting readers of all ages who appreciate the compelling storytelling and relatable characters.
Many YA books have been adapted into successful film and television adaptations, further increasing their visibility and impact on popular culture.
